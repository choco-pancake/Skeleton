            <div class="def" id="def40">They have a moderately long body with strong, broad shoulders and a short neck. Their distinctive "van" pattern is a result of the piebald white spotting gene, which restricts color to the head and tail. Turkish Vans have large, oval, expressive eyes and their semi-long coat is soft and silky, with a cashmere-like texture. The coat is water-resistant, which helps the cats stay warm in their native mountainous region.  </div>
            <div class="per" id="per40">Personality</div>
            <div class="def" id="def1_41"> Turkish Vans are known for their friendly, outgoing, and playful personalities. They are highly intelligent and active cats, enjoying playtime and interaction with their humans. They are also known to be quite vocal, expressing their needs and desires with meows and chirps. However, Turkish Vans are not typically lap cats and prefer to be on their own terms. </div>

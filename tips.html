            <div class="tips" id="p24">TIPS FOR CARING YOUR FELINE FRIEND</div>
            <div class="tips" id="p24_2">Every cat is an individual with unique needs and preferences. Pay attention to your <br> cat's behavior and adjust their care routine accordingly. With love, attention, and proper <br> care, you can ensure a long and happy life for your feline companion. <br><br> </div>
            <div class="font" id="font1">Food and Water:</div>
            <div class="tips" id="p24_3">Choose a diet specifically formulated for cats, considering their age and activity level. <br> Avoid feeding them human food, as it can be harmful. Always provide fresh, clean water, <br> ideally in multiple locations around the house and establish a regular feeding schedule to <br> prevent overeating and maintain their weight. <br><br> </div>
            <div class="font" id="font2">Grooming:</div>
            <div class="tips" id="p24_4">Brush your cat regularly, especially if they have long hair, to remove loose fur and <br> prevent mats. Cats are generally good at grooming themselves, but you may need to bathe <br> them occasionally and Trim their nails every few weeks to prevent scratching on furniture <br> and people. <br><br> </div>
            <div class="font" id="font3">Play and Enrichment:</div>
            <div class="tips" id="p24_5">Play with your cat regularly using toys like feathers, laser pointers, and catnip mice. <br> This provides mental and physical stimulation. Provide scratching posts to satisfy their <br> natural scratching instincts. Offer puzzle toys and treat dispensers to keep them entertained <br> and mentally engaged. <br><br> </div>
            <div class="font" id="font4">Veterinary Care:</div>
            <div class="tips" id="p24_6">Keep your cat up-to-date on their vaccinations to protect them from diseases. <br> Administer flea and tick preventatives as recommended by your veterinarian. Schedule <br> annual checkups to ensure they are healthy. <br><br><br> </div>
            <div class="font" id="font5">Safety:</div>
            <div class="tips" id="p24_7">Keep toxic houseplants out of reach, as they can be harmful to cats. Store <br> medications safely and securely, as cats can be curious and may ingest them. Ensure windows <br> are secured or covered to prevent falls.</div>
